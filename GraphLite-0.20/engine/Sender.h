 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file defined Sender class used to send messages between machines.

 * We temporarily choose TCP/IP as communication protocol through socket,
 * and later we may change protocol into UDP to improve performance.

 * In send-thread, Sender keeps on sending all the time if there are messages
 * in buffers. In order to send efficiently, we use select() non-blocking model
 * and set MSG_DONTWAIT flag in send(). When all buffers are empty, Sender
 * signal() main thread, and wait() until signaled by main, that is, when there
 * is at least one full buffer.
 *
 * @see MsgBuffer class
