 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file defined Receiver class used to receive messages between machines.

 * We temporarily choose TCP/IP as communication protocol through socket,
 * and later we may change protocol into UDP to improve performance.

 * In receive-thread, Receiver keeps on receiving all the time if there are
 * empty buffers. In order to receive efficiently, we use select() non-blocking
 * model and set MSG_DONTWAIT flag in recv(). When all buffers are full,
 * Receiver signal() main thread, and wait() until signaled by main, that is,
 * when there is at least one empty buffer.
 *
 * @see MsgBuffer class
